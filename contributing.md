So, looks like you want to contribute to BiomeTweaker. Awesome! Here's what to do first:
* Read all of the documentation. What you are reporting as a bug may already have a solution.
  * [Biome Generation FAQ](https://github.com/superckl/BiomeTweaker/wiki/On-the-Topic-of-Biome-Generation)
  * [Block Replacement FAQ](https://github.com/superckl/BiomeTweaker/wiki/On-the-Topic-of-Block-Replacement)
  * [General FAQ](https://github.com/superckl/BiomeTweaker/wiki/FAQ-&-Issues)
* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron that are not reproducible with forge only are **not accepted**;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is prefered to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.
  * Include the version of BiomeTweaker **and** Forge you are running. This includes the "1.8" or "1.7.10".
  * Include pictures if relevant! A good example would be reporting issues with a script command not behaving properly.

If you want to make a Pull Request keep these points in mind:
* Do NOT use the github editor. Test your PRs before you submit them.
* I'm very strict when it comes to syntax. Make sure your PR's syntax matches the syntax of the rest of the code. I will ask you to fix it if it does not.
